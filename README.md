# üìß Email & SMS Spam Classifier

An interactive web application built with Python and Streamlit that classifies messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using a trained machine learning model. This project showcases the full ML lifecycle‚Äîfrom data preprocessing and model training to deployment as a user-friendly web interface.

üîó **Live Demo**: [Click here to try the app](https://karantulsani-spam-classifier-app-app-kym0ka.streamlit.app/)

## ‚ú® Features

- **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
  Uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, known for its effectiveness in text classification tasks.

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
  Converts text messages into numerical form using Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency to enhance model performance.

- **Text Preprocessing**  
  Cleans input data with steps like lowercasing and punctuation removal for better model accuracy.

- **Interactive Web Interface**  
  Built with Streamlit, allowing users to enter a message and receive instant classification results.
